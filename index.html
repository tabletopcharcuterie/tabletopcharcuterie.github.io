      <h2>About Us</h2> 
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Annie. I'm the owner and creator of Tabletop Charcuterie. I first fell in love with charcuterie during my honeymoon trip to Italy. We found this quaint little charcuterie bar in a less visited area of Rome and decided to go inside. The variety and choices that takes place in assembling and eating the board fascinated me. Coming home to Vancouver, I started looking for local sources of charcuterie meats and cheeses to create my own.</p>
<p class="hidewithmobile">
I started making charcuterie displays for many of my social gatherings. My friends then started to ask me to make them for their bridal showers, girls night in, birthday parties, and so on. They always seem to be a crowd favorite, and definitely not camera shy.</p>
<p class="hidewithmobile">
With the pandemic happening in 2020, I don't get to create these boards as much as I like to. Thus, I decided to start my own business of making charcuterie boxes and boards to share my love of charcuterie with others.
    </p>
    <p>
Each of our board is a unique sample of flavour combinations and ideas that I am discovering and learning about each day. Our boards and boxes are affordably priced, so we can share our creations with as many people possible. Come join me in my journey discovering the world of charcuterie!
